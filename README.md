### UMBC Fall 2021 Data Science Capstone
### Instructions for use.
1. We have a data folder saved on our google drive as a shared drive. This contains the data gathered and processed in the notebooks found in this repository.
  a. Permission is required to access this folder (our professor has permission).
2. Open google colab and clone this repository into the environment.
3. Run the code of any notebook you desire- if asked to mount your drive, select the email address we have shared the drive with, and copy and paste the link.
4. Since the shared folder should show up as part of your shared drive at the user end, the folder paths should all work.
